# xstate-form

## Alpha

This module is currently in alpha

- Under continuous develoment
- API is not guaranteed until beta
- Rapid prototyping may cause bugs, inconsistencies

## React example

This core library is in parallel development with a `React` [example repo](https://github.com/jaetask/example-forms) which also contains a `useFormMachine` hook.

### API

The current create form api looks like this

```js
import { form, fields } from 'xstate-form';

const machine = form({
  fields: {
    username: fields.text('username'),
    password: fields.text('password'),
    // ...
    submitForm: fields.submit('submitForm'),
  },
  initialValues: {
    username: 'jaetask',
    password: 'ThisIsTheWay',
  },
});
```

## Validation

Form validation works via a simple JS function, (this enables any validation library, including `Yup` to be used by the user). There is a [ticket](https://github.com/jaetask/xstate-form/projects/1#card-52968847) to add Yup integration by default via `validationSchema`

```js
import { form, fields } from 'xstate-form';

const machine = form({
  // example of simple JS validation func,
  // could come from any validation library..
  validate: (values, event, meta, name) => {
    const errors = {};
    if (values.username.match(/[0-9]+/g)) {
      errors.username = 'Username cannot include a number';
    }
    if (values.password.length <= 8) {
      errors.password = 'Password must be > 8 chars';
    }
    return errors;
  },
  fields: {
    username: fields.text('username'),
    password: fields.text('password'),
    // ...
    submitForm: fields.submit('submitForm'),
  },
  initialValues: {
    username: 'jaetask',
    password: 'ThisIsTheWay',
  },
});
```

## 80/20 Rule

> There are probably as many forms as programmers

The desire is to keep the API as clean as possible, so we will always use the 80/20 rule when deciding on features. If a request fits 80% of usecases then it will be considered.

The API is a set of composable functions to help you build an `xstate` machine to handle forms. The idea is to take what you need and leave the rest, if you need an unsupported feature, feel free to copy/modify one of ours and roll your own for that specific scenario.

This approach should keep the API light, clean and easy to use.

## Typescript

This is my first typescript project, please ignore the `any` params at the moment, especially during rapid prototyping, the API will get stricter over time, promise ðŸ˜‚.
